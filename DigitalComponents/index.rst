Digital Components
##################

Boolean Algebra provides a solid mathematical basis for the design of digital
systems. Our modern computer is constructed using huge numbers of simple
electronic circuits that implement the basic operations defined in the
mathematics. In this section, we will explore the basic digital components, and
see how simple building blocks can be put together to build a useful part of a
real computer. 

Note that we are not electronics engineers, so the actual details of building
these parts is not our concern. We can thank those electronics wizards for
coming up with these powerful building blocks!
