    * Why can't we just speed up the processor clock to make a machine run faster?

    * Explain why accessing RAM (on the motherboard) is so much slower than

    * Explain how pipelining can speed up a system.

    * If the memory unit cannot deliver data fast enough, how should the
      processor act so operation can continue?
