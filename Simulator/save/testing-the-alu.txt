Testing the ALU
###############

The ALU unit we have constructed is limited to simple *ADD* and **SUB**
operations. In most machines, these instructions are *unsigned*. If we wish to
accept s*signed* operations, we need to set up different operations, since the
rules are different.

For now, we need to deal with *unsigned data only*. That means we can test the
result to see if it is greater than allowed for each size of operand. 

But, how to de check if the rrsult is too big? A simple scheme is to let our
simulator code use a higher precision variable that willcapture the sum. If
that sum exceeeds the maxixmum allowed for the real operand, we mask off the
extra bits, and set the *carry* flag.
