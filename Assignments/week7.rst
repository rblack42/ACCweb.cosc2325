Week 6 Assignments

..  include::   /references.inc

This week, we start building the ``assembly language`` for our simulator. We
will build a simple assemby language tool that will let you create code you can
load into the simulator.

Your lab project is a revision of the controller we started last week. Read the
lecture notes for this wee to see how to proceed.

Be sure to do a "git pull" in the CPUsim project to get an update to the
example code. There is more code available now., which will help you get this
lab finished.
