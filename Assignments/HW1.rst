Homework 1: Getting Started with GitHub
#######################################

..  include::   /references.inc

We need to test the basic GitHub workflow, and to do this, I am going to give
you a simple assignment designed to do nothing nmore that walk you through the
process of working on an individual assignment for this class.

Assignments will be stored in a project directory on your personal workstation
(which might be the "H" drive on your lab machine. You will not create this
directory yourself. Instead, you will be "invited" to work on the project.

The invitation comes in the form of a link you click on when a new assignment
is available. This first assignment is a bit special. It is a single project
that will contain all homework you do for this course.

Here is the link you need to start this project:

..  WARNING::

    Be sure to choose the right link here:

    * `Homework Assignment (Section 001) <https://classroom.github.com/a/cDivXZ7D>`_
    
    * `Homework Assignment (Section 002) <ihttps://classroom.github.com/a/HpZowTuG>`_
   
When you click on this link, you will be asked to "accept" this assignment.
After a bit, you should be able to navigate to the link you see on that page.
You should then be able to "clone" that repository onto your personal
workstation.  Notes in the Appendix describe the process in more detail, or you
can browse around on GitHUb_ for more information.

All you need to do for this test is add a ``README.rst`` file to the repository
with a simple message of some kind. Follow the steps we discussed in class to
add the changes to your working copy, commit them, then push ten back up to the
GitHub_ server. Again, thr notes in the Appendix cover this process.

Turning it In
*************

There is actually nothing to do to submit your work. Instead, you open up
your browser and navigate to your GitHub_ account page (after logging in). Then
navigate to your repository there. Once you see your work, you are done.
