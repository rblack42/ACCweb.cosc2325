Assignments

Assignments will be posted on this page as they are issued. Check back each
week to see what is new.

Assignments are not submitted in the usual sense. Instead we will be using
GitHub_ to manage everything you produce for this course. You will do your work
in Git_ repositories that are created in your GitHub_ account, then cloned onto
your workstation, where you do your actual work. As you complete your work, you
will "push" changes up to your GitHub_ account, and I will grade what I see
there.

There will be one repository for all homework, and individual repositories for
each lab assignment. 

When an assignment is assigned, there will be a link on this page. Navigate to
that page and look for another link for your specific section that will create
the project repository you need in your GitHub_ account. 

..  warning::

    The section links should be clearly identified. Be sure to click on the
    right link for your section. Things get ugly if you click on the wrong link.
    (You might have to do the work twice!)
