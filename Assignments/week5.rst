Homework
********

The homework this week gives you a chance to measure the speed of your
processor (and compare that to the speed of your virtual machine if you like).

The code required is pretty simple, and all I want to see is your final results
(in your Homework Repo, of course).

Lab

The next lab is designed to get you started on the real system simulator we
will build in this course. This lab is pretty simple, and focuses mostly on
interacting with that human who will run your program.
