Orientation
***********

Read the Syllabus
=================

Before you do anything, read the Syllabus for the course.

Orientation Exam
================

There is a simple orientation exam on Blackboard, designed to make sure you find
the syllabus and look it over. Look for it under "Exams" on the left side of
the BB page. Complete this exam during the first week.

..  note::

    I am not a fan of simple exams like this, so do not expect to see anything
    like this again. Normal exams will require writing in short answers to
    questions.

Homework 1
**********

You will be using GitHub_ to submit all work for this course. This first
homework assignment is designed to get you going with that system.

Lab Setup
*********

You need to install a few programs on your computer to complete this course.
The notes that will help guide you through this are in the Appendix. You need
to begin installing a virtual machine on your system to complete your lab work.
There are also a few tools you need to get familiar with as well. (See
:ref:`appendix`)

..  warning::

    You need to get your system set up right away. Putting this off will result
    in lost points on lab assignments! If you do not feel comfortable installing
    things yourself, contact me and we will work out a time and place to help get
    you through this. I hold office hours on most Saturdays at my RGC office for
    this. 

    If you absolutely must, you can use lab systems at either RGC or NRG this
    term. Both of those campuses have lab machines ready for use in this class.
