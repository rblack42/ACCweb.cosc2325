Homework
********

This week's homework asks you to do a bit of research into the terminology used
in computing. We are going to get a feel for the sizes involved in computing,

called |RST|_ to do this, but the assignment page is already set up for that.
(It will look nice on GitHub_ if you set it up right!)
