Homework
********

There is no homework for this week. Expand your lab project with the initial
ALU component.

Lab 2
*****

..  warning::

    The example **CPUsim** lab no longer tests correctly on TravisCI_. That is
    because I added complete tests for both the memory unit and the ALU, and I
    am obviously not providing the code to make those tests pass. You should
    look over the tests to see how each unit is supposed to work.

This lab will add a simple, two instruction ALU component. The two instructions
are these: **ADD** and **SUB**. However, we need to track conditions that can
lead to errors in our code. The hard part of this lab is figuring that out.
Read the companion notes on those calculations.
