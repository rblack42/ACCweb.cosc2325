Installing VMware Player
########################

If you want to run software for an operating system different from the one
installed on your machine, or if you want to create an isolated environment for
some project, you need to set up a :term:`virtual machine` on your system.
Today's modern systems, with massive hard disks and a ton of memory can handle
several simultaneous :term:`VM` systems fairly well. (The more memory you have
the better!)

For several years, I have had students set up a Linux system for the class, and
they have managed to do this on almost any system they own. I do most of my
development work on a Mac, and the lab machines all are configured with a
:term:`VM` for my courses.

Download the Software
*********************

We start off by navigating to the VMware web site and downloading the Player
program.

    * `VMware Player 7 <https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_player/7_0>`_

Choose the version that matches your system. 

Once the installer is downloaded, run it to install the application.
