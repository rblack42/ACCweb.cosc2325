Vim: A Programmer's Editor
##########################

..  include::   /references.inc

For those of you who got to this course using nothing but an IDE, you
really need to pick a good programmer's editor and learn how to use it.
The IDE is fine for learning, and may well be fine for most of your
professional development work, but you will work on a variety of
machines, and you need to be able to edit all kinds of text files on
those systems.

I have used a variant of the Vim_ editor for almost 40 years. It is
available on almost every machine I touch, and I know it well enough to
be productive immediately. I recommend it to my students, since it is
very popular, free, and works everywhere.

..  note::

    If you have yur own favorite editor, by all means use it. You are
    not required to use Vim_ in my class, but I will show examples using it
    in my lectures.
