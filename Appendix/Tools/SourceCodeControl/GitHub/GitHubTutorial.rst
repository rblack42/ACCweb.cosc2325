Getting Started on GitHub
#########################

..  include::   /references.inc

Using Git_ to manage your software is certainly new to most of you, and using a
server like GitHub to host your code is also probably new as well. This entire
software management process is a huge part of the modern programming landscape, so
learning how all this works is something you really need to invest some time in!

To get you started, 
here are links to a few YouTube videos put together by Lynn Langit, another
teacher using GitHub in her classes:

    * `Learning GitHub Part 1 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmYaZWU97GM&list=PL4Q4HssKcxYsTuqUUvEHJ8XxOVOHTSmle&index=1>`_

    * `Learning GitHub - Part 2 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx5kqLRyqLk&list=PL4Q4HssKcxYsTuqUUvEHJ8XxOVOHTSmle&index=2>`_
    
    * `Learning GitHub - Part 3 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_Ju1ZbLyk4&list=PL4Q4HssKcxYsTuqUUvEHJ8XxOVOHTSmle&index=3>`_

..  note::

    Nothing involving Git_ or GitHub_ will ever show up on a test. I am using
    this process to get you ready for that job you hope to find soon enough.
    Also, Git_ makes it easier for me to spot problems in how you approach
    programming.
