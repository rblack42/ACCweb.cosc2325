If you do much development using Python, you will need to install additional
libraries of code written by other developers to assist you in getting your
project running. This is a common practicein the :term:`open-source` community,
we all benefit from the work we all do!

Pip_ is the standard tool you should use to install these packages. Pip_ looks
for projects hosted in a popular service called the `Python Package Index`, or
``pypi``. You may want to look into this service if your project is something
you want to share with others as well.

Pip_ is included by default in Python 3.x installations. For Python 2.7 you
need to do a bit of work.
