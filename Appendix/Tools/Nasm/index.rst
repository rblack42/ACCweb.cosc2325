Installing Nasm on Windows
##########################

..  include::   /references.inc

We will be demonstrating assembly language on the Pentium processor. The most popular assembler for the Pentium is `Netwide Assembler`, `Nasm`, which will be installed in your :term:`VM`. It can also be installed on a WIndows machine if you want to try using that system (not recommended for this course). It will work on a Mac as well, but assembly language on a Mac is very different from Linux and PCs, so stick with the :term:`VM` for this class.

In case you are interested on installing Nasm on your PC, these notes will
help.

Nasm_ is a simple tool contained in a single executable file. All you need to
do is download the program, or compile it on your system, then place it in a
directory on your :term:`System Path`. You can even copy this file to a USB
flash drive and use it on any machine you happen to find available.

A compiled executable file is available here:
