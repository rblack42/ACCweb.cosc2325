C++ Project Setup
#################

..  include::   /references.inc

You will be building a reasonably big C++ project for this class, and
most of you have never set up a project in what I will call a
"professional" manner. In many cases, your employer will tell you how
your code should be organized. In other cases, Microsoft will nudge you
into a setup that makes sense only if you are using Visual Studio. Other
:term:`IDE` systems will do the same thing, so watch out when you use them!

The setup I will describe in this lecture is based on my own work over
the years, and patterns I see quite often on GitHub_ and other systems
like that. I do not claim this is the best approach, but it is pretty
good, and understanding how it all goes together will help you build
your own system when you need to!

Here are notes to guide you through this setup:
