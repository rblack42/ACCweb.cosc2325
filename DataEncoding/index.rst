Data Encoding
#############

We use a set of bits to represent data of various kinds. Exactly how we decide
to encode that data is an important part of programming. You need to understand
how data is encoded, and understand the range of values available for every
data type you use in a program.

It is also vitally important that you understand the difference between normal
human math, and computer math. We simply cannot represent numbers in a machine
accurately enough to suite all situations. Your code has to deal with the
problems that can arise when your encoding is not adequate.

    You will learn a lot about that when you take a course in *Discrete Math*.

Here are notes covering the various ways we encode common data:
